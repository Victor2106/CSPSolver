# SolverCSP

## Description

SolverCSP is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver for solving constraint satisfaction problems involving variables. This project is inspired by Z3's ability to manipulate CSP variables and browse a set of values to solve them.
This project is just a draft of a CSP solver!
